            <p>And because Umbraco is Open Source, we owe a lot of credit to our talented and helpful community when it comes to the evolvement of the CMS. Not only do we get helpful pull requests fixing bugs and suggestions for suitable features, but we also get valuable feedback from the people who use Umbraco every day.</p> <br>
            <p>And you can become part of it. You can contribute with PRs or Packages, ask or answer questions or maybe even join Umbraco meetups, festivals or conferences happening around the world - the absolute best way to “feel” what Umbraco is and discover why Umbraco developers say it’s much more than a piece of software. How to become “a member” of the community? It’s simple - just participate and contribute in a way you’re able and soon you’ll discover why we call our community the friendliest on this planet.</p>

                    <p>Imagine if your boss so very kindly hired a person to take care of all the tedious admin tasks for you; installation, site set-up, https registration, regular bug and security upgrades, deployments… Things that are necessary, but time-consuming and, let’s be frank - boring. You’d rather spend your time building great websites, right? This is where Umbraco Cloud comes in as your new time-saving digital colleague.</p>
                    <p>Based on the best and most innovative Cloud platform on the market - Microsoft Azure - we have built Umbraco Cloud as not just the perfect hosting for your Umbraco site, but also packed it with features specially designed to take tedious tasks off your hands. Umbraco Cloud provides you with safe and easy one-click deployment and upgrades as well as a better workflow for your entire team, making it simpler to get an overview of the progress as well as work alongside each other - say “goodbye content freeze!”.
